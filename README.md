# Communal Life

So what the heck is this? It's a fancy, concurrent, sorta-janky implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Users can click and move their cursor to drop cells, and they will be reflected in all the other users' browser windows. Mobile is not quite there yet I'm afraid, but mobile users can tap to drop a cell although it might be difficult to be very precise.

This was made in the pretty cool Elixir language and the also pretty cool Phoenix framework. They're pretty fun!

Why the domain sicklick.ca? I had it kicking around from an earlier project, a fun iOS app dealing with Cyclic cellular automaton.
